# DubPrime Loan Portfolio Simulator

A comprehensive simulation tool for managing and analyzing short-term loan portfolios with different tenors, default rates, and allocation strategies.

## Overview

The DubPrime Loan Portfolio Simulator allows credit analysts and portfolio managers to model the performance of loan portfolios with varying parameters:

- **Initial capital**: The starting investment amount
- **Interest rates**: Monthly interest rates for the portfolio
- **Tenor allocation**: Distribution of capital across different loan terms (1, 2, and 3 months)
- **Default rates**: Expected default rates for each tenor
- **Duration**: Simulation length in months

The simulator generates detailed visualizations of portfolio performance, cash flows, defaults, and returns.

## Key Features

- **Interactive UI**: Adjust parameters and see results in real-time
- **Cash Flow Modeling**: View detailed breakdowns of principal, interest, and defaults
- **Tenor-Based Analysis**: Compare performance of different loan durations
- **Default Visualization**: See the impact of defaults on portfolio performance
- **Advanced Financial Metrics**: Calculate IRR, WAL, duration, and risk-adjusted returns
- **Stress Testing**: Model portfolio performance under various economic scenarios
- **Robust IRR Calculations**: Accurately handle extreme stress scenarios with novel estimation techniques

## Financial Validation Suite

To ensure the financial soundness of the simulator, we've created a comprehensive validation suite:

### Validation Checklist

See the complete [Financial Validation Checklist](FINANCE_TODO.md) for a detailed breakdown of validation requirements.

### Testing Modules

- **test_finance_calculations.py**: Unit tests for core financial calculations
- **integration_test.py**: End-to-end tests for the entire system
- **financial_metrics.py**: Advanced financial metrics beyond basic simulation
- **stress_testing.py**: Tools for scenario analysis and stress testing

## Advanced Financial Metrics

The simulator now includes advanced financial metrics:

- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: Time-weighted returns by tenor and portfolio-wide
- **Weighted Average Life (WAL)**: Average time to principal repayment
- **Recovery Rates**: Effective recovery on defaulted loans
- **Sharpe Ratios**: Risk-adjusted returns
- **Duration and Convexity**: Interest rate sensitivity measures
- **Concentration Risk**: Using Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)
- **Cash Flow Volatility**: Variability in periodic cash flows

## Stress Testing

Analyze portfolio performance under various scenarios:

- **Default Stress**: Increased default rates
- **Interest Rate Changes**: Rising or falling rate environments
- **Allocation Shifts**: Changes in tenor distribution
- **Combined Scenarios**: Multiple simultaneous stresses
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Parameter-specific impact testing

### Robust Stress Scenario IRR Calculation

The simulator features a sophisticated multi-tiered approach to IRR calculation in extreme stress scenarios:

1. **Standard IRR Calculation**: First attempts the conventional IRR calculation using `numpy_financial.irr`
2. **Alternative Cash Flow Analysis**: If the standard approach fails, tries a restructured cash flow analysis
3. **MOIC-Based Estimation**: For severely distressed portfolios, estimates IRR using a modified MOIC approach
4. **Default-Rate Scaled Estimations**: In catastrophic scenarios, uses default rate scaling to provide meaningful negative IRR values

This advanced approach ensures that even in extreme stress cases where conventional IRR calculation fails (due to all-negative cash flows), the simulator still provides financially meaningful metrics, avoiding "N/A" or "Not calculable" results.

### Improved Financial Reporting

Stress test reports now use descriptive financial terminology for extreme scenarios:

- **Positive Returns**: Shown as standard percentages (e.g., "16.17%")
- **Minor Losses**: Displayed as "Loss (-X.XX%)" 
- **Significant Losses**: Shown as "Major Loss (-XX.X%)"
- **Severe Losses**: Displayed as "Severe Loss (-XX%)"
- **Catastrophic Losses**: Indicated as "Catastrophic (-XX%)"
- **Total Losses**: Clearly labeled as "Total Loss" rather than "-∞"

This improved terminology matches how credit analysts and portfolio managers would describe portfolio performance in real-world stressed environments.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the simulator:
   ```
   streamlit run streamlit_stress_test_app.py
   ```

3. Adjust parameters in the sidebar and explore the visualizations

## Running Tests

```
python -m unittest test_finance_calculations.py
python -m unittest integration_test.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy

Shawshank Redemption Part 2

"the kingdom of God is within you" from Luke 17:21 suggests that goodness and the potential for the kingdom of God are present within each person, not just in external events or locations. This implies that individuals have the capacity to experience and embody the divine within themselves." -Luke 17:21
